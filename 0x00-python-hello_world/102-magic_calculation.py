# Here's what that code does, step by step:
# - Take the number 98 and store it in the computer's memory.
# - Take two more numbers, called "a" and "b", and store them in the computer's memory too.

# - Add the number 98 to the result of step 3.
# - Give the final answer back to whoever asked for it.
